Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases
Examples(Inputs-->Output):

100, 12 --> 100
99, 0 --> 100
10, 15 --> 100

85, 5 --> 90

55, 3 --> 75

55, 0 --> 0
20, 2 --> 0
*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.

def final_grade(exam, projects):
    if exam > 90 or projects > 10:
        return 100
    elif exam > 75 and projects >= 5:
        return 90
    elif exam > 50 and projects >= 2:
        return 75
    else:
        return 0

# Examples
print(final_grade(100, 12))  # Output: 100
print(final_grade(99, 0))    # Output: 100
print(final_grade(10, 15))   # Output: 100
print(final_grade(85, 5))    # Output: 90
print(final_grade(55, 3))    # Output: 75
print(final_grade(55, 0))    # Output: 0
print(final_grade(20, 2))    # Output: 0
